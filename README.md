### You In?

You In? is an app that aims to make it easier for friends to plan meetups.

Basically, it works by:
1. Users sharing their available free times (“events”) along with details they might want to do during that time (e.g., meals, drinks, study buddy). 
2. Users seeing and joining their friend’s “events” if they’re available.
