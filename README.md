### Description
This app (You In?) was built as a team project over the course of a Human-Computer Interaction class.

Preceding the code implementation, we executed user analysis, task analysis, and several prototype iterations and evaluations.

During the prototype and code implementations, we focused on integrating the most appropriate UI design principles, UI patterns, and interaction styles to ensure users could quickly and easily navigate the app.

Reports on each step are chronicled here: https://allin5340.weebly.com/

As the code was built on NativeScript+Vue, preview the app using NativeScript's tns preview (https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/docs-cli/project/testing/preview). Use an Android phone for an optimal experience.

*The app currently has no backend and, instead, works on dummy data.

### You In?

You In? is an app that aims to make it easier for friends to plan meetups.

Basically, it works by:
1. Users sharing their available free times (“events”) along with details they might want to do during that time (e.g., meals, drinks, study buddy). 
2. Users seeing and joining their friend’s “events” if they’re available.
